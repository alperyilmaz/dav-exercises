# Data analysis and visualization exercises

This repository *will* contain exercises compiled by students. Exercise questions are mainly submitted by Data Analysis and Visualization course students @YTU. But this is a public repo, input from anybody is accepted.

# How to submit an exercise question

Please go to `Issues` tab and click `New issue` button. Then fill in the template.

Please fill in the form to submit an exercise question. Please state the question under `Question` section. Please try to be as specific as possible when describing the problem. In `hint` chunk, you can provide a statement (which function to use, or which columns to join, etc.) or you can provide first 1-2 lines of expected result. Please refer to [Github markdown table instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/organizing-information-with-tables/) if you need to include a table.

In `solution` chunk please provide the code to solve the problem. Your solutions should be runnable in anybody's computer. Thus, please don't include file locations in your own computer while importing data. The data should be coming from a R package or from an online source.
